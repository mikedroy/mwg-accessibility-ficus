        <h2 aria-hidden="true">Getting Better.</h2>
        <p aria-hidden="true">We've improved our invisible header, but it's still not fully accessible yet.</p>
        <p aria-hidden="true">Using your screen reader and keyboard, attempt to:</p>
        <ol aria-hidden="true">
            <li aria-hidden="true">Determine what types of products this fictional store sells</li>
            <li aria-hidden="true">Find a Item inside a Item Group</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>After you've tried to answer those questions, press the button below to visually show the header.</p>
        
        <button aria-hidden="true" class="button" id="showHeader">Show Header</button>
        
        <p aria-hidden="true">You probably discovered you're able to better navigate than you were in the previous version. But there's still some work to do.
        Here are the improvements made so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li aria-hidden="true">Anchor tags have HREF attributes added to be defined as links</li>
            <li aria-hidden="true">TabIndex attributes have been added to items</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p aria-hidden="true">When you're ready to move on, click "continue lesson" to move on to phase 3.</p>
